CCM3 Column Radiation Model (CRM) description:

CCM3 CRM is a standalone version of the column radiation code employed
by the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3).
The CRM is composed of the radiation routines from CCM3, along with 
an interface that allows the user to input information needed by the 
radiation calculation.

Two input data files are included, one for clear sky 'mls_clr.in', and
one for cloudy sky 'mls_cld.in'. These are text files containing
pressures, temperatures, cloud information, etc. required for input
(for more information, see comments at end of these files). The output
files are called 'mls_clr.out' and 'mls_cld.out'; these result from
running the compiled CCM3 CRM on a Sun workstation with the
corresponding input data files.

The number of levels for CCM3 CRM can be changed (by editing the
preprocessor variable PLEV and PLEVR in params.h) to whatever vertical
levels are desired.  However, if this is done, the input data file
must be changed to include all levels of data. Other changes to the
radiation model would require the user to modify the appropriate
internal code.
  
For references to articles in the scientific literature which
describe the radiative transfer methods, see comments in routine
'radcsw' for the shortwave, and 'radclw' for the longwave.

Changes in CCM3 CRM compared to CCM2:

CCM3 CRM is similar to the CCM2 CRM.

In the shortwave, an aerosol has been added. It's optical depth (visible)
is set in 'aermix'. Sulfate optical properties are used in 'radcsw'. For
clouds, mixed phase particles are used. Ice fraction is determined based
on temperature. Liquid water and ice particle effective radius are set 
using pressure; liquid water size is also distinguished between continental
and maritime surfaces; see routine 'cldefr'. See routine 'radcsw' for 
description of the ice optical properties.

The solar constant has changed, from 1370 W/m2 in CCM2 to 1367 W/m2 in CCM3.

The surface albedos are the same in CCM3 Column model as in CCM2 Column 
model, but they are treated differently in the actual CCM3 code. In that
code, the albedos are specified by the Land Surface Model (LSM).

In the longwave, several trace gases (CH4, N2O, CFC11, and CFC12) are now
included. Also, two window bands of CO2 are included. 
Liquid water cloud effective radius is prescribed, but the ice particle 
radius is allowed to vary. See routines 'cldefr' and 'cldems' for details.

Changes to CRM I/O are described in the INSTALL file.

Where to find more information:

The most recent source code and distribution of the CCM3 CRM is to be
found on the World Wide Web under URL http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/crm
Significant changes to the CRM will be announced to the community via
the ccm-users email list, see 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/ccm3/ccm-users.html
for instructions on how to join this list.

The physics routines underlying the CRM are fully described in 
NCAR Tech. Note 420, "Description of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3)".
(available in postscript format from
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/ccm3/TN-420/index.html).

Those interested in modifying the CRM for their own purposes may find
the notes on code organization at the beginning of crm.F useful.
