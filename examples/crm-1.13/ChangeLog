	* Changed criterion for printing out SWCF ratio so that now ratio
	is printed whenever SWCF(TOA) != 0.

Fri Mar  6 11:44:13 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added FAQ to distribution

	* Added '-DDOUBLE' precision option to produce a double precision
	netCDF output file. '-DDOUBLE' should be specified whenever
	compiling the CRM with '-r8 -i4'-type promotion. 

Mon Mar  2 22:33:39 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Announced release of CRM version 1.13

Thu Feb 19 15:08:12 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Installed Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) module and common
	block. Cleaned up and reformatted output. 

Mon Nov  3 14:33:35 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Unannounced release of CRM version 1.12

	* Probably a netCDF3 vs. netCDF2 related bug appeared in ncvptg()
	in netcdf.F. Work around has been to define plon=plond=PLON=1 in 
	pmgrid.h and prgrid.h and use ncvpt() output routine instead.
	This has side effect of reducing most array sizes by a factor of
	four. Unfortunately, pmgrid.h and prgrid.h must now be maintained
	outside the default CCM source tree.

	* Starting this ChangeLog for the CRM. Everything before this
	entry has been merged in by hand.

	* Announced release of CRM version 1.11

        * Imposed aerosol extinction optical depth has been changed from
          0.12 to 0.14 in aermix.F. This resolves an inconsistancy between
          the CRM and CCM3.

Mon Jan 13 22:52:55 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Announced Web page availability of CRM version 1.10 at CSM
	Atmospheric model working group meeting in Boulder.
